**<p align="center"> Data Set Summary**
  
The Iris flower data set or Fisherâ€™s Iris data set is one of the most famous multivariate data sets. It was introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper 'The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems' as an example of linear discriminant analysis. The data set consists of 50 samples from three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals, and the length and width of the petals. 
  
**<p align="center"> Project Tasks**
  
1. Research the data set online and write a summary about it in README.
2. Download the data set and add it to your repository.
3. Write a program called analysis.py that:
            3.1. outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file,
            3.2. saves a histogram of each variable to png files,
            3.3. outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables, and
            3.4. performs other appropriate analysis.

**<p align="center"> Python Libraries Used**
  
Pandas - The pandas library is a useful package for importing labelled data such as the iris data set.
    
NumPy - The NumPy package is useful as a container for multidimensional data which makes NumPy arrays easier to work with, manipulate and analyse.
    
eaborn - Seaborn is a Python visualization library that provides a high-level interface for drawinge statistical graphics.
    
Matplotlib - The Matplotlib python library is used to make charts such as histograms, plots and bar charts.
